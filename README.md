# search-a-punk
Simple react app 
The application fetches CryptoPunks data from https://cryptopunks.herokuapp.com/api/punks and shows image, id and accessories for each CryptoPunk from a random sample of 20. Then you can filter the showed punks by accesories with the searchbox.

The fetched sample is limited because otherwise the webpage where the images are stored will throw a 429 server error.

## How to use:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start

Based on https://github.com/aneagoie/robofriends tutorial.
